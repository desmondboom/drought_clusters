# Name of the dataset used to calculate gridded drought metric (must not contain spaces) -- will be used to organize paths
dataset: MERRA2

# Region where this analysis is carried out (must not contain spaces) -- will be used to organize paths
region: Global

# Name of the drought metric (must not contain spaces) -- will be used to organize paths

# Names of the variables in the NetCDF file with the drought metric
lat_var: lat
lon_var: lon
metric_var: percentiles

# Start and end years for the drought metric
start_year: 1980
end_year: 2018

# Threshold for drought definition (if using percentiles, 0.2 corresponds to 20th percentile)
drought_threshold: 0.2

# Threshold for minimum cluster area (km^2)
minimum_area_threshold: 10000

# Set boolean variable of whether to treat the right/left edges of the map as periodic
periodic_bool: True

# Path to the directory where the drought clusters will be saved
# The full path where the clusters will be saved is recommended to take the following order:
#       clusters_full_path = clusters_partial_path/dataset/region/drought_metric/drought_threshold/
# This will allow for easy organization if clusters are calculated for multiple datasets,
# regions, variables, and drought thresholds.
